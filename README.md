# primeshot Revenue Projection Tool

A web application that visualizes how primeshot can scale to $500K in revenue by the end of 2025 by modeling photographer usage, events, brand upsells, and attendee conversions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

#### Deploying to Vercel

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel. Follow these steps to deploy:

1. Create a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) if you don't have one
2. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
3. Run `vercel login` and follow the prompts to authenticate
4. From the project directory, run `vercel` to deploy
5. Follow the prompts in the CLI to configure your deployment
6. Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL to access your application

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from the Vercel dashboard:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Log in to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "New Project" and import your repository
